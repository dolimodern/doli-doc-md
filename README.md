# Documentation for Dolibarr modern (new version)

## Docker
I've created a fork of https://github.com/Monogramm/docker-dolibarr (which was excellent)
and only applied the needed containers in docker-compose.yml
So now we have nginx (alpine) +php-fpm (alpine) +mysql or mariadb
and a phpmyadmin container

Current version only sets up current dolibarr
